# Coding Standards

The Pyblish codebase has a very strict and consistent coding style. If you are to develop for Pyblish, it's a good idea to stick with it!

- A vast majority of these rules conform with [PEP8][1] and as such it is recommended that you familiarise yourself with it.
- For docstrings, you must follow the [Google Napoleon convention][2].
- For code complexity and health, you are advised to adhere to [pylint][3] and [pyflakes][4]; both of which are probably available as linters to your IDE.

This list will continue to grow and get more specific, watch this space.
